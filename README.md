<Intro>

We, a group of students from varsity college were tasked with creating a collections app on android studios, 
with data being stored on firebase. 

</Intro>

<Prerequisites>

Screenshots of some of the apps pages are attached below so you can see how it works.

If you would like to run this application you will need android studio, and a type of mobile emulator.

The online database has a time limit, before it deletes itsself. Contact @jmarx1208 if you would like 
instruction on how to reinstate the connection.

</Prerequisites>

<Usage>

Once donwloaded, you can login with the username: admin@gmail.com and password: admin55.
You are also welcome to sign up, you just need the username to be in email format.

Once logged in you will see the categories and a couple buttons. When clicking on the categories,
you will see all items of those categories. And inside you can add new items to those categories.

The piechart button shows a visual representation of the distibution of items stored.

The user icon takes you to the profile page.

The goals button allows users to set goals as to how many items they want in each category, and
uses the switch to show or hide. 

</Usage>

<Conclusion>

The app runs fine, and was fun to learn android studios development. Keep in mind its still
incomplete and has certain features that arent currently working as they should.

</Conclusion>
